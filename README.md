Project 4: Predictive Modeling of Handset Prices

Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate handset prices based on their features. The goal is to identify the most significant features that affect handset pricing and provide actionable insights for handset manufacturers and marketers to refine their pricing strategies.

Objectives

1. Develop a predictive model to estimate handset prices based on their features.
2. Identify the most significant features that affect handset pricing.
3. Provide actionable insights for handset manufacturers and marketers to refine their pricing strategies.

Key Findings

- The top 5 mobile models by average price are:
    1. APPLE iPhone 14 Plus: ₹80,999
    2. SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G: ₹79,999
    3. Google Pixel 7: ₹55,999
    4. APPLE iPhone 12: ₹53,999
    5. MOTOROLA Edge 30 Ultra: ₹49,999
- Apple and Samsung dominate the top 10 list, with average prices ranging from ₹40,332 to ₹80,999.
- The top 5 features driving the price of a mobile phone are:
    1. Model (importance score: 0.2989)
    2. Total Memory (importance score: 0.2366)
    3. Battery Life (importance score: 0.1843)
    4. Total Camera Resolution (importance score: 0.1379)
    5. Processor (importance score: 0.0710)

Insights

- Total Memory is a key driver of price, with a strong positive correlation between the two.
- Total Camera Resolution is also an important feature that affects price.
- AI Lens is a cost-effective feature that does not significantly impact price.
- Mid-range models offer a balance between features and price, making them an attractive option for consumers.

Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights for manufacturers and consumers, highlighting the importance of considering key features when making pricing decisions or purchasing handsets.
